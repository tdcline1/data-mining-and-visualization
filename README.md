# Project Overview

This project aggregates data from multiple sources, processes API responses and local datasets, and creates visualizations to analyze and present the results.

## Data Sources

- **APIs:**
  - GitHub API
  - Hacker News API

- **Local Datasets:**
  - CSV files containing weather data
  - GeoJSON files for wildfires and earthquakes

- **Statistical Simulations:**
  - Dice roll statistics
  - Random walk data

## Data Processing

- Utilized the `requests` library to fetch data from external APIs.
- Employed the `pathlib` module to manage local file paths.
- Processed and normalized API responses and local data files for further analysis.

## Visualizations

- **Matplotlib:** Used for creating static, high-quality plots.
- **Plotly Express:** Used for generating interactive, web-based visualizations.
